# V8 Randomness Prediction  

A Python script for predicting random numbers generated by V8 (used in Node.js and Google Chrome).  

## How V8 Generates Random Numbers  

V8 uses the **Xorshift128+** algorithm for generating random numbers. This algorithm maintains two internal 64-bit states and produces random values by applying a series of bitwise operations on these states.  

### Buffer Mechanics  

Every time you call `Math.random()`, V8 retrieves a number from an internal buffer containing **64 precomputed values**.  

- The buffer is **cycled**—when all 64 values are consumed, it is refilled **in reverse order**.  
- If you know all 64 values, you can accurately determine the **state of the buffer** and predict future `Math.random()` outputs.  
- Even if you don’t have all 64 values, it is still possible to determine where the buffer **wraps around** by analyzing repeated sequences. This allows you to reconstruct the buffer's position and make accurate predictions.  
- **If you don't provide enough random numbers to make an accurate prediction, the code will crash. This ensures that you never get incorrect predictions.**  

## Usage  

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KonradowyPL/V8-random-prediction
   cd https://github.com/KonradowyPL/V8-random-prediction
   ```  

2. **Create a Python script and import the module:**  
   ```py
   import V8random

   # Paste this JavaScript code into your Chrome developer console or in Node.js:
   # for (let i = 0; i < 64; i++) console.log(Math.random());

   sequence = [
       # Paste the results here
   ]

   generator = V8random.solve(sequence)
   print("Here are the next few Math.random() results:", next(generator), next(generator), next(generator))
   ```  

3. **Paste the JavaScript code into the Chrome developer console or a Node.js environment.**  
4. **Copy the printed results and paste them inside the `sequence` list in the Python script.**  
5. **Run the Python script to predict upcoming `Math.random()` values.**
